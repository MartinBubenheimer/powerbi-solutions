# Date Table w/ Tabular Editor Formatting Automation

This solution consists of

* A PowerQuery function to generate a date table. Just copy this function into your PowerQuery editor.
* A Tabular Editor script to run all fomatting: sort-by-columns, descriptions, visibility, folders, etc.

Language: English
Data (e.g. month names, weekday names) can be generated in selected languages, but meta data (field names, descriptions, formats) are currently only localized in English.

The PowerQuery function is based on ideas by Lars Schreiber https://ssbi-blog.de/
