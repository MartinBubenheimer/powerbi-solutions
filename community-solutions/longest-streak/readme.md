# Count Most Recent Streak

I've been looking at the similar questions here and I just cannot get anything to work. The ultimate goal of this is to make a leader board of who has the longest streak.

left hand side is names and the top is the week number.

so the results would looksomething like:

2

14

1

0

etc.

this is the function that is displaying the ones:

and this the column that gives the week number:
