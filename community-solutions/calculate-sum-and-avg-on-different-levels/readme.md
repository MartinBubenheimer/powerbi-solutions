# How do I write a measure that averages column totals?

Beginner user here and have never asked a question in a forum before so I apologize in advance for the simplicity of the question or info I might miss adding for context.

I have this table that I'm trying to replicate from Excel. I have included a screenshot of the Excel version and the Power Bi version. I want to display the average of the sums of each quarter. I am displaying this single value in a card (the one that is showing 131.85% right now) (I couldn't figure out how to do it in the table matrix). I know it can be done with DAX as a measure but can't seem to figure out what that would be. Is there an easy way to do this? I want the average to be off the quarters that have data, excluding the zeros for the future quarters).
