# Latest Status (for Candidate Tracking)

I am working on a candidate tracking report and am struggling with the logic of how to report on the number of candidates in each status  (as of a selected date)

The data looks like this  (simplified)

Candidate	Date	Status
450	1/15/23	A
450	1/15/23	B
450	1/31/23	C
500	12/31/22	A

If the selected date on the report is 12/31/22  - then 1 Candidate is in Status A

on 1/15/23 1 is in Status A and 1  is in Status B

(Max status is used so for the status change on 1/15 "B" should be used

Thanks in advance.
