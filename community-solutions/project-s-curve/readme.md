# Moth to day - Adjustes

Thank you, in the given example, it worked perfectly, but in the actual case, there are still some errors,. My objective is to create an S-curve for this table, an S-curve for the planned values based on the "End" column, an S-curve for the projected values based on the "End" column, and a curve for the actual values up to the current day. Could you suggest another approach based on this model that I provided, keeping in mind that this model only has one project? In the original database, I have a column that identifies the projects, and the idea is that when applying a filter on the project name, it would display the curves for each project.
